		<h2 class = "leadershipTitle">Session:</h2>

		<p>
			The session is a group of elders who oversee the ministries of the church and shepherd the members of the church through servant leadership.  The heart-beat of the elder's position is 'servanthood.'  Just as Jesus Christ came not to be served but to serve (Mark 10:45), so too the elders are to be examples of servant leadership.  The qualifications for this office are described in 1 Timothy 3:1-7, Titus 1:6-9, and 1 Peter 5:2-3.

			More specifically, the role of the session is to facilitate times of prayer over any members who are sick, counsel those who have questions or concerns about the faith, conduct membership interviews, pray for the spiritual well-being of members and the conversion of non-Christians, and serve on various committees.

		<h2 class = "leadershipTitle">Diaconate:</h2>

		<p>
			Deacons are ministers of mercy who reach out to those in crisis or difficult circumstances.  Their primary task is to have mercy upon those who are suffering and afflicted in much the same way that God's mercy moves Him to relieve suffering and sorrow.  Not only do deacons relieve suffering and compassionately care for the afflicted, they also equip people to use their time, abilities, and resources wisely, and they facilitate the connection between those who have plenty of time and/or resources and those in need of someone's time and/or resources.
