	<p class = "largeBegin">The Mission of Gospel of Grace Church:</p>
	
	<p>
		We believe that God has called Gospel of Grace Church to serve Southwest Missouri as a model of a conservative reformed Presbyterian church. In doing this, we also believe our God has called us to sculpt a reformed identity which embodies the beauty and God-honoring facets of our culture. We see and highly prize the respect so many still have for the Church and their strong allegiance to Scripture. Not only do we hope to honor these admirable traits, we desire to further adorn them by making good use of the Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms (what we refer to as our Standards). We believe that our gift to our community, already so enriched by the kindnesses of our Lord, is to faithfully present the strong, biblical theology clearly enunciated in our Standards. Yet, in doing so, we wish to assure our community that we believe our standards to be subordinate to the Scripture. We hold that our standards are by no means on par with scripture but are nevertheless a faithful exposition of the glorious truths and doctrines found in scripture. We regard our standards as Godâ€™s gracious gift that we are called to steward and share with our area. But our mission is not just to disciple but also to evangelize. While being faithful to teaching and preaching biblical doctrine, we seek to balance such with the free offer of the gospel. We believe our God has called us to offer the gospel call for all to believe upon the Lord Jesus Christ. This we believe is our call and our gift to Southwest Missouri.
