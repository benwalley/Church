	<h1>Worship</h1>

	<p>
		You may be wondering what style of worship we offer; is it contemporary, traditional, blended, avant garde, stuffy?  Many professing Christians prefer one style or another. We believe that the question is not what style do we prefer, but what does God prefer?   Worship is the “work of the Holy Spirit in the Body of Christ to the glory of God the Father.” (Worship According to Scripture, H. O. Old) We worship God because He created us to worship Him.   Our worship gives glory to Him. In worship He is glorified when we hear again of His grace toward us in the gospel and when we express our gratitude to Him in praise and thanksgiving.

	<p>A great danger in worship, however, is that it easily becomes self-centered and not God-centered.   Of course, while there are many dimensions of worship that must be adapted to the culture of the worshipers, eg. we will use English in our services, these dimensions are fewer than we imagine.  In the Scriptures, God gives many guidelines regarding true worship and warnings regarding novelty. Our worship is guided by two key principles.</p>

	<p>	In addition to our belief that worship music lyrics should accurately reflect biblical truths, we also believe that our musical worship should be: </p>

	<p>
		First, worship must be according to Scripture.  When Jesus remarked once that God was seeking worshipers who would worship Him in Spirit and Truth, he draws a clear distinction against both a style of worship that is exuberant and energetic, but not bounded by Scripture, and formalistic style of worship which is carefully scripted by chapter and verse but lacks the gracious presence of the Holy Spirit.   Neither of these is worship according to Scripture. We are not rigorist with respect to a rigid liturgy. As our forefathers before us, we believe that God has told us how he wants us to worship Him. What we are to believe concerning worship “is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men.” (Westminster Confession of Faith, I.VI)

		Second, our worship is relational. We are relating to our God in worship and doing so as a community rather than as individuals.  It is a gracious and thankful conversation between God and His people. Consequently, worship contains lots of congregational participation.

		Our worship would be considered by most today as traditional.   We sing psalms and hymns and sing with accompaniment. We confess our sins with a corporate prayer of confession and hear from Scripture the assurance of our pardon.   We profess our faith by reciting together one of the historic confessions of the Christian church such as the Apostle’s Creed, the Nicene Creed, or the Westminster Confession.   Preaching is from the Bible, passage by passage, covering whole books of the Bible over a period of time. We corporately recite the Lord’s Prayer. We will frequently observe the Lord’s Supper.  At the end of each service we receive the Benediction and enjoy some informal fellowship. Click here to see an example of our order of service

		Because our worship seeks to glorify God through proclaiming His grace to us in the gospel and by expressing our gratitude to Him in prayer, praise, and thanksgiving, our worship contains lots of congregational participation — it is a gracious and thankful conversation between God and His people.
