							Our primary standard is the Bible.  We believe the Bible is the foundational and ultimate authority for the Christian faith and life.  Without the Bible the church and all men are lost; with the Bible the Holy Spirit powerfully leads men to find God through Jesus Christ. 
 						</div>
 						<br>
 						<div>
							The Bible has one overarching and central message: God's massive redemption and restoration plan through Jesus Christ.  Beginning in Genesis 3:15 with a promise and culminating in Revelation 21 & 22 with a tear-free, sorrow-free city (the New Jerusalem), God's redemption plan centers on the Person and Work of Jesus Christ, and especially on His Cross.  The entire Bible is first and foremost about Jesus Christ: The Old Testament predicts Him (Luke 24:25-27-44-46); the Gospels reveal Him; the book of Acts preaches Him; the Epistles explain Him; and Revelation expects Him.
